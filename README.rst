pinku
=====

``pinku`` is a `Pinboard <https://pinboard.in>`_-to-`Buku <https://github.com/jarun/Buku>`_ importation utility.

``pinku`` is **not** (at least at this time) a syncing utility and works in only one direction: to import bookmarks *from* Pinboard *into* Buku. If the URL already exists in Buku, the entry is skipped over.

Installation
------------
``pip install pinku``

Usage
-----
Ensure that you have set the ``PINBOARD_API_KEY`` environment variable to your Pinboard API token. You can find your API token `here <https://pinboard.in/settings/password>`_.

``pinku`` takes command-line arguments that serve as filters for searching through Pinboard bookmarks. ``pinku`` will then add the results to your Buku database.

Pinku supports all of the filter arguments for the Pinboard API ``/all`` endpoint. Please visit `Pinboard's API documentation <https://pinboard.in/api>`_ to read the details.

**Please note that Pinboard limits API calls to the /all endpoint to once every five minutes**
